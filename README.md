Stationery Items Inventory Management
Problem Statement

Objective
Create a "Stationery Items Inventory Management" application using JavaScript to explore various array methods and operations. This project will help you understand arrays, indexing, and how to access elements using their index. You will manage an inventory of stationery items in a store. You will use loops like for...of to iterate through inventory items and practice methods like slice, splice, push, pop, shift, upshift, reverse, join, and tostring. You will also learn how to delete elements from the inventory using the delete operator.
